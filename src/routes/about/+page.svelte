  <div class="container">
    <div>
      <h3>Discovery</h3>
      <p>
        It all begins with a discovery session where we get to know your goals,
        brand story and audience. By asking the right questions and reviewing
        any existing assets, we shape a clear project brief, timetable and set
        of success metrics that guide the entire build.
      </p>

      <div class="circleContainer">

            alt="Illustration of a person consulting with another person"

      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>
        Next, we turn ideas into visuals. Starting with low-fidelity wireframes,
        we map out user flows and page layouts before crafting high-fidelity
        mockups that bring your brand to life. You’ll explore a clickable
        prototype, share feedback, and watch us refine typography, imagery and
        interactions until everything feels just right.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <div>
      <h3>Build</h3>
      <p>
        Once the design’s locked down, our developers write clean, semantic
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the right framework for your project.
        Every component is built with performance, scalability and accessibility
        in mind, so your site not only looks great but also loads fast and
        adapts as your needs evolve.

      <h3>Test</h3>
      <p>
        As we approach completion, we run both automated and manual testing
        across browsers and devices, audit Core Web Vitals and check against
        WCAG guidelines. We’ll squash any bugs, polish animations and ensure
        every interaction is rock-solid before giving you a final walkthrough.

      <h3>Deploy</h3>
      <p>
        When you’re happy, we configure your hosting environment—SSL
        certificates, CDN setup, DNS configuration and domain all handled for
        you—and then push your site live. But we don’t stop there: we keep an
        eye on performance metrics, analyse user behaviour and offer ongoing
        maintenance, so your digital presence stays sharp long after launch.

      <h3>Maintain</h3>
      <p>
        Once your site is live, we dont just step away. We perform regular
        backups and security updates. We will also run periodic reviews of user
        analytics to identify bottlenecks or oportunities for enhancement. This
        proactive maintenance keeps your website secure, optimised and evolving
        in line with your ambitions.
